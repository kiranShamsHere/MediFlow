## Project Overview
**MediFlow** is an enterprise-grade medical logistics platform engineered to solve the "Last Mile" medical supply crisis. By combining **Generative AI** for demand forecasting with **Heuristic Optimization** for redistribution, MediFlow transforms a fragmented, reactive supply chain into a proactive, life-saving ecosystem, specifically targeting cold-chain pharmaceutical integrity.

## The Problem | The Solution
**The Crisis:** Rural clinics often face 30% higher stockout rates for essential antibiotics, while urban hospitals simultaneously dispose of expired stock due to over-purchasing. This inequality is compounded by the lack of intelligent monitoring for cold-chain medicines (vaccines, insulin).

**The MediFlow Solution:** We don't just track inventory; we **predict** shortages before they happen and **automate** the movement of medicine from surplus hospitals to deficit clinics using road-accurate route optimization, ensuring that every life-saving resource is allocated where it’s needed most.

## Data & Schema
MediFlow utilizes a hierarchical Firestore schema designed for high-concurrency performance:
*   **`/facilities`**: Metadata, type (urban/rural), and geospatial coordinates.
*   **`/inventory/{fac_id}/medicines`**: Sub-collection tracking individual batches and live stock levels.
*   **`/requests`**: Global collection for tracking movement, status (Pending/Approved/Fulfilled), and manifest details.
